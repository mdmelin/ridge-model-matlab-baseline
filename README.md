# ridge-model-matlab-baseline

Minimal dataset and code to run the original MATLAB implementation of the ridge regression encoding model. 

This code is tested on MATLAB R2021b (and is known to NOT work on R2022a).

Access data [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytS-GJyO_08lYxg9EYDKpBzDChS8Vr1z/view?usp=sharing). Edit main.m with the proper data path then run this script for an example. Will include some additional plots in the future.
